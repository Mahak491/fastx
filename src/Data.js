      info:'Ok, so the first one on this list is technically from the last century, the 1990s to be exact, but it’s here as a benchmark and baseline for the models that follow. A top speed of 231 mph. Back in 1992, no other production car had ever gone that fast. It was mind-blowing. But that’s what the McLaren F1 did; blow minds. With its feather-weight carbon-fiber chassis, single-minded focus on shaving weight and a bespoke six-liter, 627 hp BMW V-12 for power, it could sear to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds.',

Fast forward a half-decade, and the Super Sport version of the Veyron promptly claimed the Guinness Book of Records title in 2010 as world’s fastest production car with a 260 mph run at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg test track.'

      info:'2013 was an auspicious year for supercars, with no fewer than three major releases debuting from McLaren, Porsche, and Ferrari and earning the “Holy Trinity” nickname. Though fiercely individual, each of the trio claimed a hybrid power-train layout.Of the three, only the Ferrari LaFerrari boasted a V-12 engine— and a raucous, naturally aspirated one, at that. The LaFerrari also happened to be the most powerful (and, unofficially at least) the most charismatic of the wild bunch. Eponymously named to suggest it was the quintessence of the Ferrari nameplate, the 950 hp hypercar may go down in history not only as the pinnacle of its era, but also as one of the greatest prancing horses of all time.'

      info:'Of the three renowned hybrid hypercars that debuted in 2013, two (the Ferrari LaFerrari and Porsche 918 Spyder) hailed from long-established carmakers, while the other—the McLaren P1—was a relative newbie on the scene. Not that the British manufacturer hadn’t earned itself a spot in the hypercar pantheon with the 1990s-era legendary F1, but the lengthy absence made building this flagship like starting from scratch.McLaren used advanced carbon-fiber construction based on its lesser, more approachable (relatively) offerings, but the top dog P1 claimed a screaming 903 hp and a remarkably lightweight chassis, which made it a more than worthy contender against the supercar establishment of the time.'

      info:'The 918 Spyder was a true game changer, demonstrating the potential of plug-in hybrid technology in the supercar stratosphere. A naturally aspirated, 4.6-liter V-8 with 599 hp got added power from two electric motors, for a total output of 877 hp and 944 ft lbs of near instant-on torque. Penned by Porsche’s chief designer, Michael Mauer, the 918 was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in 2010 as a concept to gauge market interest, going into production in late 2013 with a base MSRP of $845,000. The entire allocation of—surprise—918 units, sold out by the end of 2014, so eager were VIP Porschephiles to acquire the most powerful street-going Porsche ever made. Production ended by mid-2015, and the 918 remains a highly desirable collector car today.'

And one of the mightiest models to leave that factory is the Regera, brainchild of company founder Christian von Koenigsegg who was, reportedly, inspired after a few sprints in a Tesla Model S P95.The Regera, however, runs on hybrid power combining three electric motors with a 5-liter V-8. The power-train configuration, in total, produces a staggering 1,700 hp—all of which completely and wonderfully upends the image of Swedes being models of self-restraint',

But four years after the model’s debut in 2014, it was decided that this Italian raging bull needed a track-focused makeover. Carbon-fiber bumpers, skirts and an adjustable wing removed weight and added downforce, while an engine massage bumped horsepower up 5 percent and took the coupe’s zero-to-60 mph time down to just less than 3 seconds.The interior was just as race oriented, with sports seats and digital speedometer off the Aventador. All that added up to a brief but celebrated 2016 track record at Germany’s haloed Nürburgring, not bad at all for a company whose roots were in tractors. '

Back in the engine bay is a monstrous AMG-tuned power plant, this time a six-liter twin-turbo V-12 producing 738 hp.Wrapped around the driver and passenger of this roofless wonder is a tub made from a combination of carbon fiber and titanium for greater stiffness and lighter weight. But those are just the raw specs for a vehicle perhaps best known for being as meticulously refined as a Swiss watch, a true tastemaker’s triumph. '

Its legend became cemented with a Nürburgring-shredding session in the “Faszination” video.The latest CTR, marking its 30th anniversary, once again appears approachable at first glance, but this time around it boasts an entirely bespoke carbon-fiber chassis hiding a cornucopia of exotic hardware, from inboard suspension to a quick-revving 700 hp power plant. At once classic and futuristic, the CTR marks a momentous milestone against the original Yellowbird, offering a wildly capable supercar that hides in a discreetly familiar body.'

But it’s the car’s savage, rock-out-of-a-catapult performance and breathtaking capability, both on and off the racetrack, that heighten its near-mythical appeal.Unveiled in 2017 with production set at 500 examples, the $960,000 Senna is a road-legal, super-lightweight track missile powered by a 789 hp, mid-mounted four-liter twin-turbo V-8. It can run zero-to-62 mph in just 2.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph. While we think the F1 still ranks as the ultimate McLaren, the Senna is certainly right behind it. '

Billed as a street car tribute to Ferrari’s SF90 Formula 1 machine, the SF90 Stradale is an unabashed hypercar boasting 1,000 hp from three electric motors and a twin-turbo V-8.Its combination of exceptional hybrid power-train performance and dramatic looks pull from the best of existing aft-engined models. Note the nod to the 488’s flank scoops as well as to the marque’s racing pedigree—the nose simply screams motorsport, which this car salutes by name: Scuderia Ferrari, 90 years.'

Inspired by that achievement, the manufacturer created the eponymously named Chiron Super Sport 300+.Limited to 30 examples worldwide, it’s distinguished by carbon bodywork that extends the longtail by 9.8 inches, along with aero enhancements that improve high-speed performance by further lowering drag and increasing downforce. It’s about power too, where the 8.0-liter, W-16 quad-turbocharged engine produces 1,600 hp, 100 hp more than a “garden-variety” Chiron. As regards fuel consumption, depending on how fast you drive, your mileage may vary. '

SSC isn’t new to the high-speed business. In 2007, its 1,287 hp Ultimate Aero clocked 256.14 mph. The record stood for three years before Bugatti’s Veyron Super Sports came along. But on January 17, 2021, the SSC Tuatara took the record back with two runs that averaged 282.9 mph, and the results were verified by Racelogic. More recently still, it officilly clocked 295 mph.'

      info:'While Lamborghini’s lineup of 21st century road cars is more outlandish than ever, nothing earns street cred more than how track-worthy a model is. Enter the Essenza SCV12, Lambo’s postmodern hat tip to track specials of yore like the Diablo GTR and Miura Jota.Freed from the constraints of road legality, the Essenza uncorks Lamborghini’s naughtiest impulses from bow to stern. Extreme bodywork yields over 2,600 pounds of downforce, more than a GT3 race car and, liberated from emissions equipment, the hulking 6.5-liter, 819 hp engine is Lambo’s most powerful V-12 yet. Then there’s the futurist cockpit, which features a button-and-dial-clad steering yoke that wouldn’t be out of place in a Formula 1 car. And although the 40 buyers of the $2.6 million Essenza won’t have their own competition series, Lamborghini promises Essenza-only track days that should satisfy the owners’ race cravings.',

However, the heart of the LPI 800-4 speaks more to Lamborghini’s hereafter than any sheetmetal could, namely an 802 hp, hybrid power train that seals the deal on the future relevance of the Raging Bull marque.',

For starters, the battery-powered Nevera obliterated internal combustion records by routing 1,914 hp to all four wheels, eclipsing zero-to-60 mph times of everything from McLarens to Koenigseggs. More shockingly, the EV hypercar is the brainchild of 33-year old Croatian wunderkind Mate Rimac, who founded the firm in 2011.The Rimac Nevera’s early impact arose from its sensational performance stats, but the legacy of this hypercar will transcend a mere model. In summer 2021, the Croatian startup purchased a majority stake in Bugatti, marking the first (and likely not the last) time a legacy supercar brand falls under the control of an EV upstart. ',
